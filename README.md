# Cookble
A User Friendly Cooking/Baking Recipe Site

## Site Description:
The most common complaint when it comes to searching for cooking/baking recipes on the internet is that cooking/baking recipe sites tend to crowd content in with the recipe, therefore making it hard for the user to read the recipe whilst cooking/baking it. This is because almost all recipes come from blogs, which tend to become more monetised for the writers and/or the site owners added income. 

## Site Link:
This is not curently an official site link, however there is a Github Pages deployment that works as a backup.
